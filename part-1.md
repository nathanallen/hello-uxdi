# Think Like a Computer

## Kyrel
Kyrel is a simple browser-based game for learning about control flow and loops in javascript.

### Setup
1. Visit the [kyrel browser](http://nathan.codes/kyrel/).

1. Click on the squares to change them from blank, to blue, to green.

1. Type your code in the coding area:
    - e.g. `k.moveRight()`
1. Press the "Run Code" button to execute your code.

### Rules
- Kyrel always wakes up on the left side of the screen.
- Kyrel can not "fall off" the screen.
- Blue is Kyrel's favorite color. Kyrel uses blue by default.

### Methods
The following special methods are available for controlling kyrel so that you may traverse/transform the row:

* `k.moveRight()`
* `k.moveLeft()`
* `k.useGreen()`
* `k.useBlue()`
* `k.draw()`
* `k.erase()`
* `k.onGreen()`
* `k.onBlue()`

## Turing Machines
Kyrel is reminiscent of a turing machine that manipulates a strip of tape, transforming it from an initial state to a final state.
